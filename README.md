### 3. That's it!

This is an app designed to safely and securely round up all of your approved transactions to the nearest dollar, and give what's left over to awesome charities and non-profits that you choose. It will automatically push your round ups to the organizations that you choose once you hit a threshold of $5.00 or more.
