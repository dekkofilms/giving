## About

This is an app designed to safely and securely round up all of your approved transactions to the nearest dollar, and give what's left over to awesome charities and non-profits that you choose. It's as simple as

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Linking up your bank account  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Choosing a few of your favorite charities, and  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) That's it!

It will automatically push your round ups to the organizations that you choose once you hit a threshold of $5.00 or more.
